# DDoS-attack-classification-and-botnet-prevention
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems overwhelm 
the resources of a targeted system, causing a denial-of-service to legitimate traffic. These attacks 
are carried out using botnets, networks of infected computers and IoT devices controlled remotely 
by the attacker. DDoS attacks come in various forms, including SYN floods, UDP floods, HTTP 
floods, Ping of death attacks, ICMP floods, Smurf attacks, Fraggle attacks, and NTP amplification 
attacks. While DDoS attacks have evolved into sophisticated activities, machine learning and deep 
learning approaches can be utilized to help combat and mitigate the impact of these attacks. DDoS 
attacks pose significant risks to online organizations, leading to financial losses, erosion of 
consumer trust, and long-term reputation damage, making it crucial to develop effective defense 
strategies.
